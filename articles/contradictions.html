					<h1>Contradictions: The Destruction of the things we love</h1>
					<p>by Waldo E Walle</p>
				</header>
				<p><q>In a state of crisis one is faced with questioning the meaning of existence: why are we here for? After endless sleepless nights and anxiety attacks there will be those who will simply surpass the crisis and continue to live their roles unquestioningly, either utilizing the material conditions under which they exist consciously or unconsciously, as an excuse to avoid any forms of change. Nonetheless the question will always lurk in the background. Alternatively few will arrive partially to an answer —through privilege or suffering —  by instead shifting focus to the practice of that which will continue to animate their body to wake up to the everyday. I, as many others have found a meaning in the aesthetic cultural practices that breed constant creative forms, innovations, and play. </q></p>

				<p>Yet, <strong>there are dangers hidden in aesthetics</strong>: Its ability to shape the world into a myriad of forms and manipulate perception clouds our ability to see essence beyond materiality, beyond an eternal illusions of newness that continually shape our desires and ideas of historical progress. Therefore there seems to be a need —for those who praise the ephemeral evoking of emotions, the tangible, and the reactionary— to deny aesthetics in order to examine the threats implicit to cultural practice. Hence, if we are to continue the production of new forms, we need to place cultural practice within the complete picture of society: its social, economic, historical, and spatial context in order to arrive to effective countercultural practices for the future of the arts beyond devalued commodifications. Since it is clear today that whatever we make, it is utilized for contrary agendas, that all valued qualities are commodified to the highest bidder, efficiency is downgraded to remain a necessity and even spatial consequences emerge when a desired centrality to cultural production is commodified to trigger the destructive processes of gentrification. </p>

				<p>In order to understand the current state of things it is crucial to abstract modernity and capitalism as cyclical reproduction of particular characters under a particular setting: The Bourgeois whom are faced with the need of reproducing the power relations under capitalism, and therefore seek to continuously expand to commodify new forms of cultural production. And its Other, a non-yet-commodified character who represents those impoverished, foreign cultures and the avant-garde.</p>
			
				<h2>Bohemia and the Bourgeois</h2>
			
				<p>The unity between of these opposites is the Bohemian, a character that emerged along with modernity and since has become a character integral to city life.  Bautiller called these character the painter of modernity, a character at the center of city life that lives on the edge, unable to consume, and under the boredom of commodified lifestyle of the city and seeks to create new forms that expands and fulfill new desires. He has served the role of reimagining city life by reimagining his life.</p>
				
				<p>It is clear thus, that post-war economic prosperity also know as the golden age of capitalism brought along incremental wealth and the conditions necessary for the emergence the particular character of the non-conforming bohemian which throughout different cycles has reproduced its liberation which has brought along an "overproduction of objects, signs, messages, ideologies, and satisfactions."  Jean Baudrillard, sociologist and cultural theorist, defined the liberations of the 1960s counterculture as “the orgy” for its multiplicities of liberations. Such as the “political liberation, sexual liberation, liberation of the forces of production, liberation of the forces of destruction, women's liberation, children's liberation, liberation of unconscious models of representation, as of all the models of anti-representation.” This was a particular moment of eruption brought specifically by the failure of the Keynesian model of economics in bringing a stable market even after the so called “golden age of capitalism”, the emergence and cultural shift to a postindustrial society in the global north and furthermore the limiting representation of modernity. It is within this context that many identifiable subcultures emerged in the postindustrial cities of Europe and America, such as beatniks, hippies, punks, hip-hop’s B-boys, Disco’s LGBTQ, that as much as these expressed the discontents of the era, also created new aesthetics, practices and forms of living that defined their identities.</p>
				
				<h2>The Space of Bohemia</h2>
				
				<p>The emergence of modern bohemian cultural productions has always been firmly rooted and produced in space. Through the process of the emergence, space undergoes a transformation that produces a spatial commodity. David Harvey utilizes the term “monopoly rents” to define how space is commodified through the means of special attributes. It is through this term that we are able to understand the role of artist and subcultures in the process of gentrification. Which first emerged when real estate developers learned to utilize —and later on promote— centrality to cultural production (nightlife, artist studios, mom and pop stores, happenings, graffiti, art galleries) in order to attract high-income residents that maximized their profits.</p>
				
				<p>The bohemization of mass culture, has lead to an accelerated process of gentrification that is able to exist without the necessities of new bohemian production. In this advanced form, real estate developers have learned to mobilize already commodified and easily mass produced images of bohemian culture (bars with craft beer, coffee shops, newly constructed lofts that resemble the industrial lofts of SoHo) in order to increase the value of real estate. Nonetheless, this process promotes maximizing profits which results in an unequal displacement through the increase of property prices, a mobilization of purely consumer forms of bohemian spectacle (coffee shops, graffiti as advertising, music venues that bring already famous bands, rather than the local upcoming) and a space devoid of any possible conditions for the emergence of new forms of bohemia.</p>
				
				<p>In this regard, the image of bohemia has become a mainstreamed standard castrated from its previous association for cultural revolution, and therefore it is not helpful to define bohemia as a fixed image but rather as a practice. In this thought perhaps Paulo Freire, writer of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, offers a useful definition for bohemia in his book, as the process of liberation by the creation of a self defined image. This makes bohemia a process which must exist in trial and error process and outside a commodified structure that attempts to squeeze profits. This leaves all bohemian practices in a struggle of constantly appropriating marginal city areas —such as obsolete industrial buildings and low income neighborhoods— in order to find cheaper rents and/or larger spaces to maintain its alternative practices. In the process the bohemian has become the urban pioneer, a temporary resident that serves real estate development by initiating the destructive process of gentrification by developing the amenities necessary to attract high-income residents to the area.</p>
				
				<h2>Critique is only the first step</h2>
				<img src="../img/contradictions/berlin-squatters.jpg" alt="Squatter house Berlin Protest">
				<p>So, here we are, living in a contradictory economic system that continually squeezes individuals to maximize time and space in order to afford rent, that creates a socioeconomic context that destroys the natural emergence of new cultural practices in the city, renders dullness and repetition through standardization and low risk investment, and simultaneously incorporates and celebrates whatever new successful aesthetics get created ascending these artist to the markets hegemony (through artist collaboration and corporate sponsorships, and plethora of knockoffs). This situates the artist, the non-conformist-bohemian and creator of new signs and desires, fuel of the machine of capitalism in a point of divergence. To ignore this message and continue on fooling yourself struggling to achieve the next cool thing, or instead to dream collectively for a new utopia, founded not upon a fixed form, but rather on creating a context that enables freedom and space for the permanent reimagining, remaking and consumption of culture.</p>
				
				<p>Through technological power, Modernity bred the conditions to eliminate survival and expand those who are able to live in leisure, therefore it is important to recognize the role of the working class, and mass production technological power as it connected humanity through internet infrastructures, new mediums of expressing and a mass production of livelihoods in the form of shelter, and clothing. However it is equally important to separate it from the non-stop machine of “growth” that only brings about contradictions. This utopian context is founded upon emancipating society from rent which currently acts as shackles of time and space that maintains us stuck in a cycle of planned obsolescence to maintain “growth”. So that we can dream and make the things that matter and create a healthy city that permits reinvention whenever we collectively desire it, therefore aiming to shift to communal forms of land ownership which offer safe spaces for cultural production. In order to bring forth this new context it will be necessary for artist of all forms, to harvest their aesthetic skills as driver of desires and channel this power to right of the city.</p>
