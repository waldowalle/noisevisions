				<p>From the 1960's to 1970's, Art Scenes and Music Scenes were intertwined with grassroots mobilizations to the problems posed to their common world. It was during such period wherein Artist organizations fought against the predestined urban renewal of SoHo New York<sup><a title="Zurkin, Sharon. Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change. John Hopkins University press. 1982.">[1]</a></sup>, Grassroots Hip Hop uplifted the Bronx from its decaying state<sup><a title="Rubble Kings. Directed by Shan Nicholson. 2010.">[2]</a></sup>, and squatter movements emerged in Berlin that appropriated the surplus of housing.<sup><a title="Forkert, Kristen. The Persistence of Bohemia. City: Analysis of Urban Trends, Culture, Theory, Policy, Action. 2013.">[3]</a></sup></p>
				<p>From this era —which importantly was also defined by mass media— new cultural aesthetics and practices were produced which radically redefined bourgeois valuations upon the artist lifestyle (studios, art gallery socializing, and cafe’s), cultural production (spectacle, happenings and music shows), and art as a product (the craft of the work itself, becoming artist). And thus, what once was a practice of the bohemian suddenly became the mainstream, completely blurring the duality in conflict between the bourgeois and the cultural revolutionary bohemian.<sup><a title="Wilson, Elizabeth. The bohemianization of mass culture. International Journal of Cultural Studies 2, no. 1: 11-32. 1999.">[4]</a></sup></p>
				<p>In the process, society has further intensified aesthetic fetishism and developed an acute awareness in emergent aesthetics which become celebrated and materialized in global institutions which promote culture through top-down approaches, and serve as cultural centerpieces for attractive real estate development– Guggenheim Bilbao, Red Bull Music Academy, The Shed, etc. The production of cultural institutions has become means of reorganizing the declining industrial city to its post-industrial conception; a city that commodifies on ephemerality and materiality of spectacle — therefore all artistic production.<sup><a title="Areso, Ibon. Bilbao’s Strategic Evolution: The Metamorphosis of the Industrial City. MAS Context, no. 30-31 (2017). http://www.mascontext.com/issues/30-31-bilbao/bilbaos-strategic-evolutionthe-metamorphosis-of-the-industrial-city/.">[5]</a></sup> As such through incorporation, it creates a homogenizing environment by means of accessibility.</p>
				<p>It is here that we are able to visualize the failure of bohemia in conceiving an urban imaginary that rebelled against the bourgeois conception of the world, as these have merely been appropriated and subjectified. And therefore we need to reconsider, that perhaps bohemia relevance was never about a revolution of values, as much of these claimed, but rather that these produced a setting —specifically in the peripheries of the city— wherein active counterpublics emerged to produce a new urban imaginary. As such these emergent counterpublics engaged (successfully or unsuccessfully, fully or partly) with the issues faced by its public, and subjected the periphery to a process of transformation that would reconfigure the center points of the city. In conclusion, the scene emerges and produces a public that has proven to have a transformative capability.</p>
				<p>Such transformation is of course with the contradictions that arise from the double blurring between bohemia and bourgeois, and between periphery and centrality, and in conjunction form the essence of gentrification. But maybe if we question the process of transformation, we should be able visualize openings for alternative transformations. The scene emerges naturally within the periphery “against the Eye and the Gaze, against quantity and homogeneity, against power and the arrogance of power, against the endless expansion of the ‘private’ and of industrial profitability; and against specialized spaces and a narrow localization of function”<sup><a title="Lefebvre, Henri. The production of space. Translated by Donald Nicholson-Smith. Malden, MA: Blackwell. 2009.">[6]</a></sup> but as soon as these appear the Eye is attracted, and as such subject the scene to the same question: Will they serve to raise concerns of social justice of the periphery, or simply feed unto the hegemony of real estate centralization through means of spectacle, which will render the scene’s self-destruction?</p>
